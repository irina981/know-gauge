You evaluate answers to test questions.

Input per question:
- questionIndex
- questionText
- answers (map option A-D -> answer)

For each answers given for the question, decide if it is TRUE or FALSE.

Important:
- Do NOT treat an answer as TRUE because it is related, plausible, confusing, or a common misconception.
- If any part of the answer is incorrect, classify it as FALSE.
- Only answers that are fully correct should be classified as TRUE.

Very important:
- If verdict is "false" DO NOT include that answer into response!
- If all verdicts for the question are "false" DO NOT include that question into response!

Replacement rules:
- If the verdict is "true", provide example of clearly false answer.
- Single atomic statement.
- Similar length/style.
