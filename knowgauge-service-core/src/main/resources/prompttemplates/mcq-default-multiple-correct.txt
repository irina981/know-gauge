You generate MCQs from the provided context.

Difficulty: {{difficulty}}
Number of questions: {{questionCount}}

Use ONLY the context below. 
If you cannot produce the requested distribution of multi-correct questions using only this context, return exactly: INSUFFICIENT_CONTEXT.

===== CONTEXT START =====
{{context}}
===== CONTEXT END =====

Requirements:
- Return exactly {{questionCount}} questions.
- Each question has 4 options A–D. Each option must be one atomic statement (no bundled lists).
- Exactly {{minMulti}} questions must be multi-correct (2–4 correct options). The rest must be single-correct (exactly 1 correct option).
- Correct options must be explicitly supported by the context.
- Incorrect options must not be supported by the context and should be clearly wrong or out-of-scope for the asked concept (avoid “near-miss” options).
- For multi-correct questions, do not reveal the number of correct answers in the question text (avoid “Which two/three/four…”). Use “Select all that apply” or similar neutral wording.
- Provide a 1–2 sentence explanation based only on the context.
- Include sources as chunk IDs you used to derive the question (e.g., "chunk8"). Use 1–3 chunks per question.
